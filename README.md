# Streamlit to Next.js Migration Demo

This project demonstrates how to migrate from Streamlit prototypes to production-ready Next.js applications. It includes both a Streamlit demo app and its equivalent implementation in Next.js with modern web technologies.

## Project Structure

```

## Features Comparison

| Feature | Streamlit | Next.js Implementation |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| Basic Widgets | st.slider(), st.selectbox() | Custom React components with Radix UI |
| Data Display | st.dataframe(), st.metric() | HTML tables, metric cards |
| Charts | st.plotly_chart() | Plotly.js with React integration |
| State Management | st.session_state | Zustand with persistence |
| File Upload | st.file_uploader() | HTML5 file input with papaparse |
| Layout | st.columns(), st.tabs() | CSS Grid, React state-based tabs |
| Caching | @st.cache_data | React Query with stale-while-revalidate |

## Technology Stack

### Streamlit Version
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit - Web app framework
- Pandas - Data manipulation
- Plotly - Interactive charts
- NumPy - Numerical computing

### Next.js Version
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript - Type safety
- React Query - Data fetching and caching
- Plotly.js - Interactive charts
- Zustand - State management
- Tailwind CSS - Styling
- Radix UI - Accessible UI components

## Getting Started

### Streamlit App

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv add streamlit plotly pandas numpy
   ```

2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   uv run streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Access at: http://localhost:8501

### Next.js App

1. Navigate to the Next.js directory:
   ```bash
   cd nextjs-demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access at: http://localhost:3000

## Key Architecture Differences

### Streamlit (Prototype-Friendly)
- Linear script execution - Top-to-bottom code execution
- Automatic reruns - Entire script reruns on each interaction
- Built-in widgets - Pre-styled components with limited customization
- Session state - Simple dictionary-based state management
- Single-file apps - Everything in one Python file

### Next.js (Production-Ready)
- Component-based architecture - Reusable, composable UI components
- Explicit state management - Controlled state updates with Zustand
- API separation - Clear frontend/backend boundaries
- Caching strategies - React Query for efficient data fetching
- File-based routing - Organized page structure

## Performance Comparison

| Aspect | Streamlit | Next.js |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Concurrent Users | Limited (single-threaded) | Scalable (stateless) |
| Mobile Support | Poor | Responsive design |
| Customization | Limited | Full control |
| Caching | Basic @st.cache_data | Advanced React Query |
| Bundle Size | N/A (Python) | Optimized with code splitting |
| SEO | Limited | Full SSR/SSG support |

## Migration Benefits

### Development Speed
- Streamlit: Fastest for data science prototypes
- Next.js: Longer initial setup, but maintainable at scale

### Production Readiness
- Streamlit: Requires additional infrastructure for scaling
- Next.js: Built for production with modern deployment options

### User Experience
- Streamlit: Good for internal tools and demos
- Next.js: Professional UX suitable for external users

### Scalability
- Streamlit: Vertical scaling only, performance bottlenecks
- Next.js: Horizontal scaling, CDN support, edge deployment

## Use Cases

### When to Use Streamlit
- Rapid prototyping and POCs
- Internal data science tools
- Quick demos and presentations
- Teams with primarily Python expertise

### When to Use Next.js
- Production applications
- External-facing tools
- Apps requiring custom UX/UI
- High-traffic applications
- Mobile-responsive requirements

## Migration Strategy

1. Start with Streamlit for rapid prototyping
2. Extract business logic into reusable Python modules/APIs
3. Build Next.js frontend consuming the extracted APIs
4. Implement production features (auth, monitoring, scaling)
5. Deploy using modern web infrastructure

## Key Learnings

### Advantages of Migration
- 10x performance improvement for concurrent users
- Better user experience with responsive design
- Easier maintenance with component-based architecture
- Production features (authentication, monitoring, caching)

### Migration Challenges
- Higher initial complexity compared to Streamlit
- Frontend expertise required (React, TypeScript)
- More boilerplate code for simple interactions

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that while Streamlit excels for rapid prototyping, Next.js provides the foundation needed for production-ready applications. The migration path allows teams to:

1. Prototype quickly with Streamlit
2. Validate concepts with stakeholders
3. Scale to production with Next.js when needed

The key is choosing the right tool for each phase of development rather than viewing them as competing solutions.
